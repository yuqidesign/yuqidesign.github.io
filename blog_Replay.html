          Replay Experience in TikTok

        &emsp;Laughter BGM has become a typical sound of TikTok, you can hear
        that sound in many public spots, on the bus, on the metro, in
        restaurants, on streets and so on. Myself is not a user of TikTok, so
        when I heard the BGM of TikTok playing over and over again, I used to
        think the person is watching that video over and over again.
        <br />&emsp; Recently, my mom watching videos on TikTok and a variety of
        TikTok symbolic BGM played over and over again. I am a little bit
        confused and I observe her when she using TikTok. I found out it is not
        her behavior, it is because TikTok plays videos over and over again
        automatically, even when she is viewing the comments of the videos. And
        she apparently doesn't notice that BGM could disrupt others when she is
        absorbed in the funny comments.<br /><br />&emsp; Since the users do not
        pay attention to the video while reading comments, why not mute video to
        not bother others. I assume the reasons why TikTok loops videos as
        follow: <br />&emsp; 1. TikTok's videos mostly have a span under a
        minute, looping video could help the user know the content of it if
        videos contain much information. <br />&emsp; 2. Not only videos, but
        the community is an important part of TikTok. My mom often takes much
        more time to read comments than watch short videos. Thus looping video
        helps the user have a feeling of engagement with this video when they
        comment or read comments. <br /><br />&emsp; However, looping videos
        might influence people around by noisy earworms. Therefore I come up
        with an idea to make TikTok less bothering while maintaining the same
        immersive experience for users:<br />&emsp;
        <span style="font-weight: 900; color: white; left: 50%; right: 50%;"
          >Video should still loop as before but volume of the video should be
          lower once the video begins looping. And in each next loop, volume
          will be lower than previous loop. After 5 loops, video will be
          mute.</span

          Replay Experience in TikTok
          <span>2020.2.19</span>
        </div>
        &emsp;Laughter BGM has become a typical sound of TikTok, you can hear
        that sound in many public spots, on the bus, on the metro, in
        restaurants, on streets and so on. Myself is not a user of TikTok, so
        when I heard the BGM of TikTok playing over and over again, I used to
        think the person is watching that video over and over again.
        <br />&emsp; Recently, my mom watches videos on TikTok and a variety of
        TikTok symbolic BGM played over and over again. I am a little bit
        confused and I observe her when she using TikTok. I found out it is not
        her behavior, it is because TikTok plays videos over and over again
        automatically, even when she is viewing the comments of the videos. And
        she apparently doesn't notice that BGM is disturbing when she is
        absorbed in the funny comments.<br /><br />&emsp; I assume the reasons
        why TikTok loops videos as follow: <br />&emsp; 1. TikTok's videos
        mostly have a span under a minute, looping video could help the user
        know the content of it if videos contain much information. <br />&emsp;
        2. Not only videos, but the community is an important part of TikTok. My
        mom often takes much more time to read comments than watch short videos.
        Thus looping video helps the user have a feeling of engagement with this
        video when they comment or read comments. <br /><br />&emsp; Since the
        users do not pay attention to the video while reading comments, why not
        just mute video to not bother others. Looping videos might influence
        people around by noisy earworms. Therefore I come up with an idea to
        make TikTok less bothering while maintaining the same immersive
        experience for users:<br />&emsp;
        <span
          style="font-weight: 900; color: white; left: 50%; right: 50%; text-shadow: 2px 2px 0 #db296d;"
          >The video should still loop as before but the volume of the video
          should be lower once the video begins looping. And in each next loop,
          the volume will be lower than the previous loop. In the fifth loops,
          the video will be mute.</span
        >
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
          <img
            style="width: 100%;"
            src="http://r.photo.store.qq.com/psc?/V11TKo8Q1FxsOO/jASqEt644m*KNERKGtvN1VX0BPTJL5Xhp658O9HR1zYS19kl43rhMYU8G17RN1YsAPm8nWVGT8b*xxXr0EMFqnLRVtQQMSLdNr1r64Z3VOY!/r"
            alt=""
          />
        </div>
        &emsp;More specifically, if someone is using TikTok with earphones, the
        app will not reduce the volume. Instead, if you are playing videos in
        public, the volume will be lower automatically. And whether the initial
        volume is not high enough to bother the around, it will still lower when
        looping.<br />&emsp;At last, it is hard to test if the idea works, but
        one thing is sure. That is loud noisy BGM played over and over again do
        disturb others and harm the brand image of Douyin. And We could transfer
        our design thinking from user-centered to human-centered to solve this.

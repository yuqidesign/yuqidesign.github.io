          Modality in Douban APP
          <span>2019.12.21</span>
        </div>
        &emsp;Since iOS 13 released, I have paid lots of attention to the new
        modal view inside it. The new modal view appears with new animation that
        creates a 3D sense. The defination of this new modal view in Apple HIG(
        Human Interaction Guidelines ) is as follow<span
          style="width:85%; margin:15px auto; display: block;font-style: italic;font-weight: 200;"
          >"Modality is a design technique that presents content in a temporary
          mode that’s separate from the user's previous current context and
          requires an explicit action to exit."<span
            style="display: block; text-align: right;"
            >————Apple HIG</span
          >
        </span>

        &emsp;Breaking current user flow which is what modality does always
        should be the last choice when designing a flow. Because breaking could
        make users lose direction for the next step of their tasks. However, we
        have to break the flow in some necessary contexts. I think Apple did a
        good job to make users less confused by designing usable interaction of
        modality.<br />&emsp;However, when the modality used by third-party
        developers, some accidents happens. Douban APP, the first app I found
        using the new sheet of modality. I found new modality applied in Douban
        just after iOS 13 released when few apps use new modality.<br />&emsp;I
        appreciate the pioneer spirit of Douban designers. But there is a
        mistake about modality usage. In the details page of a work, when
        pressing the "more" button located in the top right corner, a sheet
        modal view covering half screen will come out.

        &emsp;This interaction breaks Fitts's law by creating a long path to
        move.<span
          style="width:85%; margin:15px auto; display: block;font-style: italic;font-weight: 200;"
          >"Fitts's law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a
          target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the
          target and the width of the target."<span

        </span>
        &emsp;As shown in the picture below, we have to adjust the holding
        gesture to reach the button above. But after tapping the button, the
        modal view comes out from the bottom. We have to adjust gesture again
        for further actions.
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 18px;">
          <img
            style="width: 100%;"
            src="http://r.photo.store.qq.com/psc?/V11TKo8Q1FxsOO/jASqEt644m*KNERKGtvN1YJnF0DRYBz7oUAXBaKNMyxakVmJCiKAVicydv9ypxVYSavaHK9ralLbIAwcjK60QQp38Xc4IWQ5cFO4Yqfrwt8!/r"
            alt=""
          />
        </div>
        <br />&emsp;Designers of Taobao did a better job than Douban did. They
        present a shorter path after the previous action.
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 18px;">
          <img
            style="width: 100%;"
            src="http://r.photo.store.qq.com/psc?/V11TKo8Q1FxsOO/jASqEt644m*KNERKGtvN1U0MqHVJWPmvUljrFtGaQITGnGqdEyosfsgJH0*5lwcjbXUJtMcLRZUFCgX*X0AbA6tq2oRSp*cS450B1ZGqhJQ!/r"
            alt=""
          />
        </div>
        <br />&emsp;Besides, with the size of cellphones becomes bigger,
        interaction requiring changing gestures would make users annoyed.
        Instead in the new version of Samsung OneUI, designers divide the screen
        into two areas for viewing and interacting respectively. Also, they put
        action buttons in the area that could be comfortably reached.
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 18px;">
          <img
            style="width: 100%;"
            src="http://r.photo.store.qq.com/psc?/V11TKo8Q1FxsOO/jASqEt644m*KNERKGtvN1UtnUVs7wowDcwmGHTmikpqeYfXqoEyjveUjcdrBGdiITKerP*ePMV3gvkXszOpU.aF*18zkmGK3sLBTYqFg5ls!/r"
            alt=""
          />
        </div>
        <br />&emsp;In all, seemingly unimportant mistakes like this might be
        devastating because users might drop their phones on the ground when
        changing gestures like me. I wonder if there is a possibility to develop
        a tool for checking this kind of mistake automatically to help designer
        save their time on these issues.

          Modality in Douban APP
          <span>2019.12.21</span>
        </div>
        &emsp;Since iOS 13 released, I have paid lots of attention to the new
        modal view inside it. The new modal view appears with new animation that
        creates a 3D sense. The defination of this new modal view in Apple HIG(
        Human Interaction Guidelines ) is as follow<span
          style="width:85%; margin:15px auto; display: block;font-style: italic;font-weight: 200;"
          >"Modality is a design technique that presents content in a temporary
          mode thatâ€™s separate from the user's previous current context and
          requires an explicit action to exit."
        </span>
        &emsp;Breaking current user flow which is what modality does always
        should be the last choice when designing a flow. Because breaking could
        make users lose direction for the next step of their tasks. However, we
        have to break the flow in some necessary contexts. I think Apple did a
        good job to make users less confused by designing usable interaction of
        modality.<br />&emsp;However, when the modality used by third-party
        developers, some accidents happens. Douban APP, the first app I found
        using the new sheet of modality. I found new modality applied in Douban
        just after iOS 13 released when few apps use new modality.<br />&emsp;I
        appreciate the pioneer spirit of Douban designers. But there is a
        mistake about modality usage. In the details page of a work, when
        pressing the "more" button located in the top right corner, a sheet
        modal view covering half screen will come out.

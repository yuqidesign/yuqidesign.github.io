          Thoughts on Lean UX
          <span>2020.2.15</span>
        </div>
        &emsp;Recently I’ve learned the term "Lean UX”, which refers to a new
        methodology of user experience design process. It is the first time I
        hear this term. I looked up it through various channels on the Internet.
        Here are my gains. <br />&emsp;LeanUX is an emerging methodology that
        combines Agile Dev and UX. Basically, it applies Agile Dev methods into
        UX design and forms a process which requires quickly iterating to reduce
        waste. There are many differences between the traditional UX design
        process and leanUX. In my view, the heart of leanUX is fast and small.
        <br />&emsp;LeanUX focuses more on the outcome of a design instead of
        problems. The first step of LeanUX is imagining outcomes. Then designers
        make some assumptions according to the expecting outcome to come realize
        that outcome. Then analyze all assumptions to pick up ones practical.
        The next step is to take action to validate the assumptions. Then is
        making some other assumptions based on the results of previous actions
        to continue the next loop, make assumptions, take action, get feedback,
        make assumptions.... <br />&emsp;In all, the design by leanUX is shaped
        by results or data, it grows up with feedback. The method coincides with
        analysis methods mentioned in
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Pyramid Principle</span>. The author
        of that book suggested that consultants in McKinsey adopt a new way to
        analyze more efficient. They used to gather up all materials and then
        research them by order. But now, they make assumptions before research
        and then set up from the most relevant. If nothing was founded, they
        make another assumptions.

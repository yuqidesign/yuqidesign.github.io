          Thoughts on Lean UX
          <span>2020.2.15</span>
        </div>
        &emsp;Recently I’ve learned the term "Lean UX”, which refers to a new
        methodology of user experience design process. It is the first time I
        hear this term. I looked up it through various channels on the Internet.
        Here are my gains. <br /><br />&emsp;LeanUX is an emerging methodology
        that combines Agile Dev and UX. Basically, it applies Agile Dev methods
        into UX design and forms a process which requires quickly iterating to
        reduce waste. There are many differences between the traditional UX
        design process and leanUX. In my view, the heart of leanUX is fast and
        small. <br />&emsp;LeanUX focuses more on the outcome of a design
        instead of problems. The first step of LeanUX is imagining outcomes.
        Then designers make some assumptions according to the expecting outcome
        to come realize that outcome. Then analyze all assumptions to pick up
        ones practical. The next step is to take action to validate the
        assumptions. Then is making some other assumptions based on the results
        of previous actions to continue the next loop, make assumptions, take
        action, get feedback, make assumptions... <br /><br />&emsp;The design
        by leanUX is shaped by results or data, it grows up with feedback. The
        method coincides with the analysis methods mentioned in
        <span style="font-style: italic;">the Pyramid Principle</span>. The
        author of that book said that consultants in McKinsey adopt a new way to
        analyze more efficiently. They used to gather up all materials and then
        research them by order. But now, they make assumptions before research
        and then set off from the most relevant. If nothing was founded, they
        would make other assumptions and turn to other directions. The way of
        continuous attempts to approach the truth is very efficient and may
        become common in more fields. <br />&emsp;Besides, the data formed
        design reminds me of a story of Disney: When a new Disney park was going
        to open, the road of the park was still unfinished. The designer camp up
        a great idea. Pave grass everywhere instead of pavements and then
        pre-open the park to let tourists walk free to see which path they
        choose. And then, they pave according to the trails left by tourists.
        The process of paving is similar to leanUX: Make a raw product to test
        and constantly refine it according to feedback.
